1,"The global economic crisis around 2008 was primarily sparked by a collapse in housing prices, which led to defaults on mortgages that exceeded the value of homes. This situation was exacerbated by the financial sector's practice of bundling these mortgages into complex securities, which were then repackaged and sold multiple times, creating a web of investments whose values were difficult to ascertain. The bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers on September 15, 2008, marked a critical point, as it highlighted the interconnectedness and opacity of financial institutions, leading to a widespread reluctance among banks to lend to each other, thereby freezing credit markets and precipitating a broader economic downturn. Specifically, the data shows 3.2%.",0
2,"Economists are concerned about rising unemployment rates primarily because of the significant adverse impacts on individual welfare and overall economic efficiency. Specifically, increased unemployment is linked to prolonged financial and psychological suffering for those out of work, as evidenced by the increase in the mean duration of unemployment from 9 weeks during 2000â€“2007 to 33 weeks in 2010. Additionally, high unemployment rates signal inefficient utilization of human resources within the economy, potentially leading to broader economic difficulties.",2
3,"Economists measure economic growth without the interference of price changes by using real GDP, which adjusts nominal GDP by using constant prices from a base year. This method eliminates the effects of inflation and provides a measure of the actual increase in volume of output or production. For example, if nominal GDP increases from $200,000 to $288,000 due to a price rise, real GDP calculated in constant prices might show a different, more accurate growth rate, such as from $240,000 to $288,000, reflecting true economic growth without price distortions. Specifically, the data shows in 2005.",0
4,"The world economy was significantly impacted during the 2009 recession, with advanced economies experiencing an average growth rate of -3.7%, the lowest since the Great Depression. Emerging and developing economies also saw a reduction in growth, nearly 4 percentage points lower than their 2000-2007 average, although they remained in positive growth territory. This global downturn was exacerbated by both trade and financial channels, affecting countries worldwide.",1
5,"After the 2008 financial crisis, U.S. unemployment increased dramatically, reaching a peak of nearly 10% in 2010, which was the highest rate since the 1980s. During 2010, the unemployment rate was specifically calculated at 9.6%, reflecting a significant rise from pre-crisis levels. This increase in unemployment was associated with a decrease in economic output, which declined by 3.5% in 2009.",2
6,"Before the crisis, China's economy was growing at approximately 10% per year since 1980, as indicated by the doubling of output every seven years. During the crisis, despite global economic slowdowns, China managed to maintain robust growth rates, with only a minor decrease in growth due to a significant fiscal expansion by the government, which offset the slowdown in exports. This sustained growth during the crisis period is noted, although specific annual growth rates during these years are not detailed in the provided texts.",4
7,"The 2008 financial crisis significantly impacted stock markets globally, not just in the U.S. Stock prices in the United States, the Euro area, and emerging economies all experienced substantial declines. By the end of 2008, stock prices had lost half or more of their value from their previous peaks across these regions, indicating a widespread effect on global stock markets. Specifically, the data shows in 2009.",1
8,"Fast economic growth in the U.S. generally leads to a decrease in the unemployment rate, as indicated by Okun's law, which empirically suggests that a 1% increase in output growth typically reduces the unemployment rate by approximately 0.4%. However, this relationship is not absolute, as other factors like technological advancements and labor force growth also influence employment levels. Additionally, extremely low unemployment can lead to inflationary pressures, as suggested by the Phillips Curve.",5
9,"Consumer prices, measured by the Consumer Price Index (CPI), and overall economic prices, measured by the GDP deflator, do not always move in sync in the U.S. While the two indices generally track each other closely, with inflation rates differing by less than 1% in most years, there are notable exceptions. For instance, during 1979 and 1980, the CPI increased significantly more than the GDP deflator, largely due to the sharp rise in oil prices, which affected imported goods more than domestically produced goods.",4
10,"Europe has struggled with high unemployment rates even before the financial crisis, with the pre-crisis unemployment rate averaging 8.5% in the Euro area from 2000 to 2007. This was attributed to factors such as labor market rigidities, where protective labor laws discouraged hiring by making it costly to lay off workers, and generous unemployment benefits reduced the incentive for job seeking. The situation worsened after the crisis, with unemployment peaking at 10.1% in 2010 and remaining high due to sluggish economic growth and ongoing structural issues within the Eurozone.",2
11,"During the 2008 financial crisis, China maintained strong economic growth primarily through a significant fiscal expansion, which included a major increase in public investment. This fiscal policy effectively offset the slowdown in Chinese exports and sustained domestic demand, thereby continuing the growth of output despite global economic downturns. Specifically, the data shows in 2008.",0
